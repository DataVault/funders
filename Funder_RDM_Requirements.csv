 *  By retaining files of all the research data they have produced and used during the course of their work, and that they be prepared to share these data with other researchers whenever they are not bound by copyright restrictions, confidentiality requirements, or contractual clauses.
 *  By seeking to establish and practice good research data management in accordance with the current best practices in their respective fields and to share their data with other researchers in a responsible way.",https://www.axa-research.org/en/page/general-terms,13/02/2018

Chief Scientist Office,N,Y,5 years,"16. Preserving and Sharing Research Data
16.1 CSO, in common with other public research funders, strongly encourages the sharing of data from research it supports. Where the data may be of interest to researchers other than the original investigators, consent from research participants should be worded in terms that enable the data to be used for secondary analysis, and datasets should be preserved in a way that encourages other analysts to use them. The best method for ensuring this is to deposit the data with full supporting documentation in a public archive, such as the UK Data Archive. CSO encourages this and will consider applications for the costs associated with archiving and data sharing (see paras 13.7 and 13.8).
16.2 CSO recognises that the original investigator has a right to a limited period of exclusive use of the data, that secondary analyses may be most fruitfully conducted in collaboration with the original investigator, and that publications making secondary use of the data should acknowledge the intellectual property of the original investigator.
16.3 Whether or not the data are likely to be used for secondary analysis, the Chief Investigator must ensure that the raw data or results are stored for a minimum period of 5 years after completion of the project. At any time during this period the data or results may be requested by CSO. If a longer period of storage is required this will be indicated in the notice of funding.",http://www.cso.scot.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/Chief_Scientist_Office_Standard_Conditions_of_Grant_Response_Mode_v1_4.pdf,13/02/2018

However, the Commission recognizes that some research data cannot be made open and applies the principle of 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'. It is therefore possible to opt out of research data sharing at any stage - before or after the signature of the grant agreement - but reasons have to be given e.g. for intellectual property rights (IPR) concerns, privacy/data protection concerns, national security concern, if it would run against the main objective of the project or for other legitimate reasons (see General Annex L of the 2017 Work Programme adopted at 25 July 2016).

""The Society supports science as an open enterprise and is committed to ensuring that data outputs from research supported by the Society are made publically available in a managed and responsible manner, with as few restrictions as possible. Data outputs should be deposited in an appropriate, recognised, publically available repository, so that others can verify and build upon the data, which is of public interest.
The Society does not dictate a set format for data management and sharing plans. Where they are required, applicants should structure their plan in a manner most appropriate to the proposed research. The information submitted in plans should focus specifically on how the data outputs will be managed and shared, detailing the repositories where data will be deposited. In considering your approach for data management and sharing, applicants should consider the following:
· What data outputs will be generated by the research that are of value to the public?
· Where and when will you make the data available?
· How will others be able to access the data?
· If the data is of high public interest, how will it be made accessible not only for those in the same or linked field, but also to a wider public audience?
· Specify whether any limits will be placed on the data to be shared, for example, for the purposes of safeguarding commercial interests, personal information, safety or security of the data.
· How will datasets be preserved to ensure they are of long-term benefit?""",https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/,20/02/2018
